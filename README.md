# sMART Optimization | Course Project (Autumn ’23)
Prof. Avinash Bhardwaj - Optimization Models
• Extended the Continuous Facility Location Problem, to find the Optimum Placement of InstaMart in a
city as a linear program, modelling various demographic and logistical factors as linear constraints
• Learned Blossom, Bipartite, and Hungarian algorithms to optimize assignment and matching problems
• Linearly formulated the problem of identifying the Maximum Sum Eulerian Circuit within an edge-weighted graph,
applying it to discover the longest closed path within the IIT-Bombay Campus using Python MIP and CBC solver
